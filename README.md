## **What is this project ?**

This project is Machine Learning/3D Platformer project developed by Bezmican Zehir. It uses Unity's version **2019.4.18f1 (LTS)** and **Universal Render Pipeline**. Also feel free to check Executable Desktop Standalone Build in StandaloneBuild folder.

### **Template Scenes**

Project includes;
* Singleplayer Scene
* Multiplayer (AI Only) Scene
* Machine Learning/Training Scene

#### 1. Singleplayer Scene

This scene is basically 3D simple platformer, player can walk in four direction. Goal is to reach finish line as fast as possible. Some obstacles and falling down will reset player's progress. 

**What can I do with this scene?**

Basically anything you want as long as you have creativity. 
* You may create your own scene using prefabs in *Assets* folder.
* You may create different physics interractions with obstacles.

#### 2. Multiplayer Scene

In this scene, player will race against AI players which is trained by Unity's **ML-Agents**. To win this scene, player has to reach the goal before AI players. Some conditions from singleplayer scene works here too such as falling down, hitting obstacles.

**What can I do with this scene?**

* You may create different levels which has increased complexity to observe how ML-Agents reacts to different environments.
* You may sit back, play and enjoy this cute game.

#### 3. Machine Learning/Training Scene

This scene is main purpose of this project.

* You may use and edit Agent prefab to create your own custom training environment.
* You may change scene design, obstacles and end goal to fit best for your training model.
